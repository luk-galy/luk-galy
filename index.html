    <p><b>Catherine Yass</b> was born in London, England, in 1963. After receiving a BA at the Slade School of Fine Art in 1986, she studied at Goldsmiths College from 1988 - 90, graduating with a Masters degree in Fine Arts.

    Yass is best known for her <i>distinctive photographic and film based</i> work. Typically she manipulates her subject matter by overlaying the negative and the positive from photographs she has taken and then realises the resultant images as lightboxes, prints and films </p>
